# Step 0: Prerequisites:
To follow through, youâ€™ll need to have Docker installed on your system as well as an AWS account.

## Step 0a: Install Docker on your system
The instructions for installing Docker on your system are available [here.](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) If you wish to run Docker on Windows or OSx, you will need to install Docker Desktop. As Docker was originally built for Linux, Docker Desktop will run a Linux Virtual Machine which subsequently launches the Linux-based image.

## Step 0b: Register an AWS account
You can register for free access to AWS services for a year at this [link.](https://aws.amazon.com/free/?all-free-tier.sort-by=item.additionalFields.SortRank&all-free-tier.sort-order=asc&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Types=*all&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Categories=*all)

## Step 0c: Install the AWS Command Line Interface
The Command Line Interface (CLI) allows you to make calls to AWS services from your Command-Line. You can follow the instructions [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html) to install the AWS CLI.
